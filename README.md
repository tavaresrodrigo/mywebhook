# Webhook for RHACS Audit Logging

## Introduction

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides audit logging to track changes, capturing PUT and POST events. You can use this data for auditing, troubleshooting, record-keeping, and monitoring gaining insights into both normal and abnormal events.

When you enable audit logging, every time there is a modification, RHACS sends an HTTP POST message (JSON f) to a Webhook you provide. This is a Python Webhook container that you can use to check the log events in the container STDOUT.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11.
* Podman or the container engine of your choice.
* Access to an OpenShift cluster for deployment. (I recommend [CRC](https://github.com/crc-org/crc) if you want to test it in your local)
* Basic understanding of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes.

## Building the Container image

Clone this repository to your local machine. Navigate to the cloned directory and build the Container:

```bash
$ podman build -t mywebhook .
```

Push the built image to a container registry:

```bash
$ podman tag mywebhook [YOUR_REGISTRY]/mywebhook
$ podman push [YOUR_REGISTRY]/mywebhook
```

## Deploying on OpenShift

Log in to your OpenShift cluster using the oc CLI. Deploy the webhook service using the image from your registry:

```bash
$ oc create -f mywebook.yaml
```


## Enabling Audit Logging in ACS:

* Log in to the RHACS Central portal.
* Navigate to Platform Configuration -> Integrations -> Generic Webhook.
* Check âœ… "Enable audit logging".

Get the route url and Fill in the Create Integration form:

```bash
$ oc get route mywebhook
NAME        HOST/PORT                                PATH   SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
mywebhook   mywebhook-acsauditlog.apps-crc.testing          mywebhook   8080-tcp                 None
```

## Viewing Audit Logs

The Webhook will display the log messages in the container STDOUT. In the example below I have cloned the Policy "30-Day Scan Age".

Use the **$oc logs -f[pod-name]** command to check the container output:

```bash
$ oc logs -f mywebhook-pod
```
```json

## Future Work: Centralized Log Management with Loki and Grafana

I am working to implement a centralized solution for viewing and analyzing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) audit logs using Loki and Grafana in the OpenShift Logging stack. Contributions are welcome.
